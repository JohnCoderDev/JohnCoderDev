- Hello, World!
- My name is John (in reality, is Jo√£o because i'm brazilian, but John is easier to pronouce in portuguese), nice to meet you!
- I love programming, I do it as my job and hobbie.
- I already programmed in C, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, OpenEdge ABL and in many other languages.
- Since programming languages are only ways to communicate with the computer, I don't think it's really relevant to say that one language is better than other.
- I would like to be recognized by my work and see the positive impact of it in companies, people, etc.
